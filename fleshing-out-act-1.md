# ACT 1
## What happens in act 1?
Well from what Scully told me act 1 is going to be exclusively the two meeting and forming a brotherhood (bond).

## So how do they meet?
I don't fucking know.  
But lets think of some ideas!

> note: the cop should probably already be in th organistaio. it might be too much for this guy to bring him in as well?

1. They are both put on the same drug route (accidentally) have an argument about it and find out that in fact both of them were supposed to be working it together.
    - from there they start off (obviously) disliking each other
    - but as time goes on working the same route all day with each other, avoiding the police, beating peopl up for money owed, pedling their wares they become close
    - so close that the criminal asks the cop to dinner at his families where you see that when the crimal isnt peddling drugs he is in fact agreat fucking guy.
2.
