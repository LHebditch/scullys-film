# ACT 1
## What happens in act 1?
Well from what Scully told me act 1 is going to be exclusively the two meeting and forming a brotherhood (bond).

## So how do they meet?
I don't fucking know.  
But lets think of some ideas!

> note: the cop should probably already be in th organistaion. it might be too much for this guy to bring him in as well?

> note: I'm also assuming that this is from the perspective of the criminal

1. **They** are both put on the same drug route (accidentally) have an argument about it and find out that in fact both of them were supposed to be working it together.
    - from there they start off (obviously) disliking each other
    - but as time goes on working the same route all day with each other, avoiding the police, beating peopl up for money owed, pedling their wares they become close

2. **They** are both leaving jail after having their bail paid and as chance would have it they are picked up by the same guy.
    - they would have to have been in for different things to have not crossed paths while inside (i think)
        - maybe the cop guy was in isolation (allegedly)
        - or maybe he was with a gang that the criminal dude didn't associate with
            - i don't know how likely you are to meet others in jail so.... 

    - the guy who picks them up says that he actually needs two guys to do a job and thus begins their partnership.

    - they do a good job on the first job and are subsequently asked to do more and through that they bond/builda brotherhood.

3. **The** criminal is on a job with a bunch of others. it doesn't go as they had planned and everyone bar our criminal dies. Except of cause his get away driver. (the driver is the 
undercover cop)
    - as the only 2 to have survived their considered failures and given some really shitty jobs to do together

    - by doing these jobs, and doing them well they are eventually given more and more serious jobs within the organisation and become good friends.
---

ultimately they become so close that the criminal asks the cop to dinner at his families where you see that when the crimal isnt peddling drugs he is in fact a great fucking guy.

So I guess by the end of act 1 they need to be real close. And i guess we need to be leading into the `big job` they go on. I think.

## What should the audience be thinking at this point
- they're both crimnals
- despite being crinminals they are both real good dudes
    - so good that in fact they both seem like protagonists
- the audience probs won't be ok with the `big job`  but they definately want our 2 guys to succeed
