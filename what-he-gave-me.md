- they need to bond
	- scene where families meet and have a nice day
	- they both have kids and are good fathers
	- important audience likes these CRIMINALS

### Decide their gunna do a big job.

### Start: They meet and become friends.
- boss makes them team up
- doing illegal shit (blowing up building, banging wwhoooorz)
- they are both into the 'cause'
- long time building character and setting up final job
- they become really good friends
- they're good eople but also bad
- spend 1.5 hours building friendship

## during the job
- 1 of the guys is an undercover cop
- he kills the other one or he lets him get killed or sees him die
	- but he's upset about it

## BIG TWIST
One of the guys was a cop, and even though he had to (kill/get killed/let die) the other he still loved him based on what they had beent through.
