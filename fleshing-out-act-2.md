# Act 2
## What actually happend in act 2?
From what I understand in act 2 we need to plan and bggin the `big job` that is so important throughout this story.

## So what is the `big job`?
Scully kept talking about a bombing. I think it'd be hard to get an audience to side with that if it's nt a comedy but we'll include it as a possibility.
1. Bombing
    - the target should be something where people aren't killed. As scully said the 2 guys aren't murderers their just devoted to the cause
    - maybe there's a mix up/complication and innocent lives are put in danger and that's what results in the death of our criminal character
2. heist? (heists aren't really a crimnal organistaion thing)
3. Drug smuggling / sale
    - could be an opportunity to buy alot or sell alot of drugs
    - they would meet at a location and i guess hit would go down
4. Attacking a rival "gang"
    - it might make sense to plan an attack on a rival gang?
